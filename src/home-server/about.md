In this tutorial, I am going to cover how to setup and run a Home NixOS server and self-host few applications like [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) which is password manager and [Immich](https://immich.app/)

For this tutorial, I will be using a [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
